0.14 (2013-08-28)
-----------------

* Supports packages that do not live in the root of a version control
  repository (`issue #15 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/15>`__).

* More reliable svn support: detect files that have been added but not
  committed (or committed but not updated).

* Licence changed from GPL (v2 or later) to MIT
  (`issue #12 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/12>`__).


0.13 (2013-07-31)
-----------------

* New command line option: --ignore
  (`issue #11 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/11>`__).
  Contributed by Steven Myint.

* New command line option: -p, --python.  Defaults to the Python you used to
  run check-manifest.  Fixes issues with packages that require Python 3 to run
  setup.py (`issue #13 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/13>`__).


0.12 (2013-05-15)
-----------------

* Add suggestion pattern for `Makefile`.

* More generic suggestion patterns, should cover almost anything.

* zest.releaser_ integration: skip check-release for non-Python packages
  (`issue #9 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/9>`__).


0.11 (2013-03-20)
-----------------

* Make sure ``MANIFEST.in`` is not ignored even if it hasn't been added to the
  VCS yet (`issue #7 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/7>`__).


0.10 (2013-03-17)
-----------------

* ``check-manifest --version`` now prints the version number.

* Don't apologize for not adding rules for directories (especially after adding
  rules that include files inside that directory).

* Python 3 support contributed by Steven Myint.

* Default ignore patterns can be configured in ``setup.cfg``
  (`issue #3 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/3>`_).


0.9 (2013-03-06)
----------------

* Add suggestion pattern for `.travis.yml`.

* When check-manifest -u (or -c) doesn't know how to write a rule matching a
  particular file, it now apologizes explicitly.

* Copy the source tree to a temporary directory before running python setup.py
  sdist to avoid side effects from setuptools plugins or stale
  \*.egg-info/SOURCES.txt files
  (`issue #1 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/1>`_).

* Warn if `*.egg-info` or `*.mo` is actually checked into the VCS.

* Don't complain if `*.mo` files are present in the sdist but not in the VCS
  (`issue #2 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/2>`_).


0.8 (2013-03-06)
----------------

* Entry point for zest.releaser_.  If you install both zest.releaser and
  check-manifest, you will be asked if you want to check your manifest during
  ``fullrelease``.

.. _zest.releaser: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser


0.7 (2013-03-05)
----------------

* First release available from the Python Package Index.

* Moved from https://gist.github.com/4277075
  to https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest

* Added README.rst, CHANGES.rst, setup.py, tox.ini (but no real tests yet),
  MANIFEST.in, and a Makefile.

* Fixed a bug in error reporting (when setup.py failed, the user would get
  `TypeError: descriptor '__init__' requires a 'exceptions.Exception' object
  but received a 'str'`).
