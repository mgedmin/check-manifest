Changelog
=========


0.42 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Added ``-q``/``--quiet`` command line argument. This will reduce the verbosity
  of informational output, e.g. for use in a CI pipeline.


0.41 (2020-02-25)
-----------------

- Support `PEP 517`_, i.e. packages using pyproject.toml instead of a setup.py
  (`#105 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/105>`_).

.. _PEP 517: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/

- Ignore subcommand stderr unless the subcommand fails.  This avoids treating
  warning messages as filenames.  (`#110
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/110>`_.)


0.40 (2019-10-15)
-----------------

- Add Python 3.8 support.


0.39 (2019-06-06)
-----------------

- You can now use check-manifest as a `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_
  hook (`#100 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/100>`__).


0.38 (2019-04-23)
-----------------

- Add Python 3.7 support.

- Drop Python 3.4 support.

- Added GitHub templates to default ignore patterns.

- Added reading check-manifest config out of ``tox.ini`` or ``pyproject.toml``.


0.37 (2018-04-12)
-----------------

- Drop Python 3.3 support.

- Support packages using ``setuptools_scm``
  (`#68 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/68>`__).

  Note that ``setuptools_scm`` usually makes MANIFEST.in files obsolete.
  Having one is helpful only if you intend to build an sdist and then use that
  sdist to perform further builds, instead of building from a source checkout.


0.36 (2017-11-21)
-----------------

- Handle empty VCS repositories more gracefully
  (`#84 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/84>`__).


0.35 (2017-01-30)
-----------------

- Python 3.6 support.


0.34 (2016-09-14)
-----------------

- Fix WindowsError due to presence of read-only files
  (`#74 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/74>`__).


0.33 (2016-08-29)
-----------------

- Fix WindowsError due to git submodules in subdirectories
  (`#73 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/pull/73>`__).
  Contributed by Loren Gordon.


0.32 (2016-08-16)
-----------------

* New config/command line option to ignore bad ideas (ignore-bad-ideas)
  (`issue #67 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/67>`__).
  Contributed by Brecht Machiels.

* Files named ``.hgsigs`` are ignored by default.  Contributed by Jakub Wilk.


0.31 (2016-01-28)
-----------------

- Drop Python 3.2 support.

- Ignore commented-out lines in MANIFEST.in
  (`issue #66 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/66>`__).


0.30 (2015-12-10)
-----------------

* Support git submodules
  (`issue #61 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/61>`__).

* Revert the zc.buildout support hack from 0.26 because it causes breakage
  (`issue #56 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/56>`__).

* Improve non-ASCII filename handling with Bazaar on Windows.


0.29 (2015-11-21)
-----------------

* Fix --python with just a command name, to be found in path (`issue #57
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/57>`__).


0.28 (2015-11-11)
-----------------

* Fix detection of git repositories when .git is a file and not a directory (`#53
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/pull/53>`__).  One situation
  where this occurs is when the project is checked out as a git submodule.

* Apply ignore patterns in subdirectories too (`#54
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/54>`__).


0.27 (2015-11-02)
-----------------

* Fix utter breakage on Windows, introduced in 0.26 (`issue #52
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/52>`__).
  (The bug -- clearing the environment unnecessarily -- could probably
  also cause locale-related problems on other OSes.)


0.26 (2015-10-30)
-----------------

* Do not complain about missing ``.gitattributes`` file (`PR #50
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/pull/50>`__).

* Normalize unicode representation and case of filenames. (`issue #47
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/47>`__).

* Support installation via zc.buildout better (`issue #35
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/35>`__).

* Drop Python 2.6 support because one of our test dependencies (mock) dropped
  it.  This also means we no longer use environment markers.


0.25 (2015-05-27)
-----------------

* Stop dynamic computation of install_requires in setup.py: this doesn't work
  well in the presence of the pip 7 wheel cache.  Use PEP-426 environment
  markers instead (this means we now require setuptools >= 0.7, and pip >= 6.0,
  and wheel >= 0.24).


0.24 (2015-03-26)
-----------------

* Make sure ``setup.py`` not being added to the VCS doesn't cause
  hard-to-understand errors (`issue #46
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/46>`__).


0.23 (2015-02-12)
-----------------

* More reliable svn status parsing; now handles svn externals (`issue #45
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/45>`__).

* The test suite now skips tests for version control systems that aren't
  installed (`issue #42
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/42>`__).


0.22 (2014-12-23)
-----------------

* More terse output by default; use the new ``-v`` (``--verbose``) flag
  to see all the details.

* Warn the user if MANIFEST.in is missing  (`issue #31
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/31>`__).

* Fix IOError when files listed under version control are missing (`issue #32
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/32>`__).

* Improved wording of the match/do not match messages (`issue #34
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/34>`__).

* Handle a relative --python path (`issue #36
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/36>`__).

* Warn about leading and trailing slashes in MANIFEST.in (`issue #37
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/37>`__).

* Ignore .travis.yml by default (`issue #39
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/39>`__).

* Suggest a rule for Makefile found deeper in the source tree.


0.21 (2014-06-13)
-----------------

* Don't drop setup.cfg when copying version-controlled files into a clean
  temporary directory (`issue #29
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/29>`__).


0.20 (2014-05-14)
-----------------

* Restore warning about files included in the sdist but not added to the
  version control system (`issue #27
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/27>`__).

* Fix ``check-manifest relative/pathname`` (`issue #28
  <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/28>`__).


0.19 (2014-02-09)
-----------------

* More correct MANIFEST.in parsing for exclusion rules.
* Some effort was expended towards Windows compatibility.
* Handles non-ASCII filenames, as long as they're valid in your locale
  (`issue #23 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/23>`__,
  `#25 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/23>`__).


0.18 (2014-01-30)
-----------------

* Friendlier error message when an external command cannot be found
  (`issue #21 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/21>`__).
* Add suggestion pattern for `.coveragerc`.
* Python 2.6 support
  (`issue #22 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/22>`__).


0.17 (2013-10-10)
-----------------

* Read the existing MANIFEST.in file for files to ignore
  (`issue #19 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/19>`__).


0.16 (2013-10-01)
-----------------

* Fix Subversion status parsing in the presence of svn usernames longer than 12
  characters (`issue #18 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/18>`__).


0.15 (2013-09-20)
-----------------

* Normalize the paths of all files, avoiding some duplicate misses of
  directories.  (`issue #16 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/16>`__).
  [maurits]


0.14 (2013-08-28)
-----------------

* Supports packages that do not live in the root of a version control
  repository (`issue #15 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/15>`__).

* More reliable svn support: detect files that have been added but not
  committed (or committed but not updated).

* Licence changed from GPL (v2 or later) to MIT
  (`issue #12 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/12>`__).


0.13 (2013-07-31)
-----------------

* New command line option: --ignore
  (`issue #11 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/11>`__).
  Contributed by Steven Myint.

* New command line option: -p, --python.  Defaults to the Python you used to
  run check-manifest.  Fixes issues with packages that require Python 3 to run
  setup.py (`issue #13 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/13>`__).


0.12 (2013-05-15)
-----------------

* Add suggestion pattern for `Makefile`.

* More generic suggestion patterns, should cover almost anything.

* zest.releaser_ integration: skip check-release for non-Python packages
  (`issue #9 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/9>`__).


0.11 (2013-03-20)
-----------------

* Make sure ``MANIFEST.in`` is not ignored even if it hasn't been added to the
  VCS yet (`issue #7 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/7>`__).


0.10 (2013-03-17)
-----------------

* ``check-manifest --version`` now prints the version number.

* Don't apologize for not adding rules for directories (especially after adding
  rules that include files inside that directory).

* Python 3 support contributed by Steven Myint.

* Default ignore patterns can be configured in ``setup.cfg``
  (`issue #3 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/3>`_).


0.9 (2013-03-06)
----------------

* Add suggestion pattern for `.travis.yml`.

* When check-manifest -u (or -c) doesn't know how to write a rule matching a
  particular file, it now apologizes explicitly.

* Copy the source tree to a temporary directory before running python setup.py
  sdist to avoid side effects from setuptools plugins or stale
  \*.egg-info/SOURCES.txt files
  (`issue #1 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/1>`_).

* Warn if `*.egg-info` or `*.mo` is actually checked into the VCS.

* Don't complain if `*.mo` files are present in the sdist but not in the VCS
  (`issue #2 <https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest/issues/2>`_).


0.8 (2013-03-06)
----------------

* Entry point for zest.releaser_.  If you install both zest.releaser and
  check-manifest, you will be asked if you want to check your manifest during
  ``fullrelease``.

.. _zest.releaser: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/zest.releaser


0.7 (2013-03-05)
----------------

* First release available from the Python Package Index.

* Moved from https://gist.github.com/4277075
  to https://github.com/mgedmin/check-manifest

* Added README.rst, CHANGES.rst, setup.py, tox.ini (but no real tests yet),
  MANIFEST.in, and a Makefile.

* Fixed a bug in error reporting (when setup.py failed, the user would get
  `TypeError: descriptor '__init__' requires an 'exceptions.Exception' object
  but received a 'str'`).
